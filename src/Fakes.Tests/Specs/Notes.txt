General concerns for writing tests:
- Have tests for null/empty/whitespace and auto-trimming on public API surface
- Have tests for directory/file missing
- Have tests for file in use (or directory is the current directory)
- Verify type of exception and message text
- Have tests for absolute/relative paths
- Have tests for UNC paths
- Have tests for extended paths (\\?\C:\folder)
- Have tests for ignoring case
- Have tests for filesystem entry type mismatches (directory that exists as file etc)
- Have tests for readonly/hidden files/directories
